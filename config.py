FPS indicates the desired refresh rate, or frames-per-second, of the audio

up with desired FPS value.
Higher framerates improve "responsiveness" and reduce the latency of the
visualization but are more computationally expensive.

Low framerates are less computationally expensive, but the visualization may
appear "sluggish" or out of sync with the audio being played if it is too low.

The FPS should not exceed the maximum refresh rate of the LED strip, which
depends on how long the LED strip is.

A small number of bins reduces the frequency resolution of the visualization
but improves amplitude resolution. The opposite is true when using a large
number of bins. More bins is not always better!
